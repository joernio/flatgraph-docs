    <description>flatgraph is a fast and memory efficient columnar graph database with support for domain specific and typesafe traversal language. Written in Scala 3.&#xA;flatgraph was developed as the underlying database for the code analysis platform joern as well as qwiet.ai’s proprietary static code analysis tools. Many design decisions were driven by the needs of code analysis, however we are certain that flatgraph is useful for other domains as well, and we’ve tried our best to make it easy to give it a go.</description>
