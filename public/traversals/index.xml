    <description>The most important basic traversal steps will be the ones generated for your domain as highlighted in glimpse-of-a-simple-use-case.&#xA;In addition to the generated domain-specific steps based on your schema, thereâ€™s some basic traversal steps that you can use generically across domains, e.g. to traverse from a node (or an Iterator[Node]) to their neighbors, lookup their properties etc. There are also more advanced steps like repeat and advanced features like path tracking which will be described further below.</description>
